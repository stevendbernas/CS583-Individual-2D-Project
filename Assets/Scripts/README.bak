Art:
***I made the cars, track, menu (sprites) using powerpoint then took a screen ***capture and saved as .PNG file

Sound:
***I took a .mp3 file from sounds and modified the sound on my sound editior and used the scripts to make it surround sound


Gameplay:
***On runtime MenuScene is displayed, then click play button opens the TrackScene where the racing game starts

***Controls on keyboard left arrow is to steer left, right arrow is to steer right, up arrow to speed up car, down arrow to slow down car

***Blue car is the player 1, red and green car are AI cars

***Special features: green arrow on track is to increases car speed and yellow arrow decreses car speed

Defect Free: 
***Found bugs earlier in development with 2D box colliders not leaving opening to take shorcuts on the track, fix was to overlap the 2D box colliders, currenly the game is ---defect free

Fun factor/Creativity: 10%. This is subjective, but will be based on a perception of the grader for how fun things are. Perhaps you have an aptitude for art or sound and incorporate this, let us know and it will be taken into account. This is a great place to argue with the graders.

***Playing the game is super fun and intense since the AI cars do not make mistakes, I tried to make the AI cars steer, speed up and slow down at corners to make it feel like ---you are racing against another human, adding the special features with the green and yellow arrow makes it more challenging since going over the wrong arrow could make you ---fall behind in the race or become ahead in the race

Code:
***Commented the code as best as I could for readability
